<h2>üåê Tech Stack Overview</h2>

### üîß Backend and Middleware

Our backend architecture supports both user authentication and media streaming functionality:

- **User & Metadata Backend**: Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB Atlas**, deployed on **Vercel**.
  - Handles user registration, authentication, session management, and stores user data such as watch history and preferences.
  - Stores media metadata such as titles, descriptions, thumbnails, genres, and watch progress in a flexible NoSQL structure.
  - Exposes RESTful API endpoints used by both the web and mobile frontends.

- **Media Streaming Backend**:
  - Hosted on an **Ubuntu 22.04.5** server with **Nginx** configured as a reverse proxy.
  - Utilizes **Jellyfin**, an open-source media server, to manage and stream video content.
  - Protected and accelerated using **Cloudflare** for CDN caching, HTTPS, DNS routing, and DDoS protection.

- **Static Asset Storage**:
  - Media thumbnails and user-uploaded images are stored on **AWS S3**, chosen for efficient delivery of large assets and to reduce load on the database.

### üíª Frontend (React Native for Web-Focused)

The entire frontend of Domain Films is built using **React Native**, primarily targeting the **web platform** via **React Native for Web** through **Expo**:

- Hosted on **AWS Amplify**, providing scalable, secure deployment and integration with the backend.
- Developed with **React Native**, designed for seamless use in desktop and mobile browsers.
- Key features include:
  - Movie/show search and filtering by title, genre, and popularity
  - Rich media pages with metadata and embedded **Jellyfin** streaming support
  - Authentication, profile management, watchlists, and viewing history
  - Fully responsive UI with dark mode and adaptive layouts

### üì± Mobile App (React Native via Expo)

The same React Native codebase powers a cross-platform mobile app:

- Developed using **Expo**, enabling easy builds and deployment for both iOS and Android.
- Mirrors the web functionality:
  - Secure login and user profile handling
  - Browsing and streaming movies/shows via native Jellyfin integration
- Offers an optimized mobile experience for on-the-go streaming.
